# Stakater Pipeline Library


## Problem

We often face situations where multiple projects were using the same CI/CD pipeline workflow(optionally with minor changes). This resulted in a lot of code duplication and redundant work when trying to update a functionality. 
We would like to watch if some change happens in `ConfigMap` and/or `Secret`; then perform a rolling upgrade on relevant `DeploymentConfig`, `Deployment`, `Daemonset` and `Statefulset`

## Solution

We decided to extract out the reusable components from different Jenkinsfile into a pipeline library making it the single source of truth and using it for CI/CD workflows of all our applications.

## How to use Stakater Pipeline Library

Just add the following to the top of your Jenkinsfile

```groovy
#!/usr/bin/env groovy
@Library('github.com/stakater/stakater-pipeline-library@v2.15.1') _
```
and you can directly use any methods available in the library.

## Acknowledgements

- [fabric8-pipeline-library](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library); We got the motivation to write our own pipeline library from fabric8's pipeline library. Initially we started by improving the existing library but felt that it needed a major revamp to cater better to our needs so we decided to write our own version of pipeline library.
